# proj2ImageProcessing

in this project we supply two ways of bluring images (in each represanation):
convolution with gaussian Kernels (in given size) and blurring with fourier
derivative transformation(while blurring done in frequency domain on the gaussian image
as a mask for low-pass filtering of the original image
